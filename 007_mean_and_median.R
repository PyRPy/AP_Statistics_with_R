
# Mean and median ---------------------------------------------------------

# let's generate some numbers first
myNumbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 9 , 18, 11, 3, 4, 6, 7)

# length of numbers
length(myNumbers)

# find mean
mean(myNumbers)

# pay attention to upper or lower case in R
mean(mynumbers)

# will be wrong

# find median
median(myNumbers)

# if we change one of numbers
# mean changes, but median stays same or called 'resistance'
