## Rolling two dices, and find out dice1 + dice2 = 7 ?
```{r}
# simulate two dice
dice1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
dice2 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

```{r}
# the number of experiments you want to run
numOfExp <- 10000
equalTo7 <- 0 # how many times the summation is equal to 7
```

```{r}
# let's write a loop and also do some conditional selections
for (i in 1:numOfExp) {
  sum2 = sample(dice1, 1, replace = TRUE) + 
         sample(dice2, 1, replace = TRUE)
  if (sum2 == 7) {
    equalTo7 = equalTo7 + 1 # use it as a counter here
  }
}
```

```{r}
probSum7 = equalTo7 / numOfExp
probSum7
```

## very close to 0.1667
## in theory, you have 6 events out of 36 sample space
## so, pob is 6/ 36 = 1 /6 = 0.1667 approximately.
