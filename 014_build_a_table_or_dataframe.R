# before we start the unit 2, let's first learn how to build a table or 
# data frame in R, it is super easy !

# assume a dog , how much a dog eat every day, as a dog grows up (a puppy this case)

cups <- c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9)
age <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10) # weeks

myDogFood <- data.frame(cups, age)

# let's display it
myDogFood

# we can find that, we build a table, a table you can use to do a lot of analysis...

# THANK YOU FOR WATCHING !
