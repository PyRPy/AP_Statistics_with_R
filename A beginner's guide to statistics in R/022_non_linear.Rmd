```

## non-linear relationship between two variables
```{r}
# create data first
x <- 0:20
y <- x^2 + rnorm(21) * 0.5
```

```{r}
# plot
plot(x, y)
```

## we can see, it is not a straight line anymore
## what we can do ? transform it !

```{r}
y_sqrt <- sqrt(y)

plot(x, y_sqrt)
# almost a straight line
```

```{r}
# let's take a look at the original data
summary(lm(y ~ x))
```

## R2 is 0.93, but the linear model would be a bad fit !
## A high R-square from a linear regression is not necessarily a good fit
