## how to spot an outlier(s)
```{r}
# let's get some data first
# let's change one of the cups values, at age = 8
cups <- c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 18, 8, 9)
age <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10) # weeks
```

```{r}
# create a data frame in R
myDogFood <- data.frame(cups, age)
```
```{r}
# linear model
linearReg <- lm(cups ~ age)
```
```{r}
# run the summary to find the R2
summary(linearReg)
```
## R-squared:  0.557, very low now compared to before (> 0.9)
## The outlier has significant impact on R-Square
```{r}
plot(age, cups) # plot it again
abline(linearReg)
```
## well, it not very nice, there is an outlier at age = 8 !
```{r}
max(abs(residuals(linearReg)))
```
