```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# let's work on hwo to find quantiles
```{r}
# assume we have these numbers:
myNumbers <- c(3, 2, 4, 6, 1, 6, 9, 11, 3, 4)
```

```{r}
# find quantiles
quantile(myNumbers)
```

```{r}
quantile(myNumbers, 0.5)

# this is equivalent to find 'median' in the numbers
```

# Inter Quantiles 

# we know the quantiles here:
# 0%  25%  50%  75% 100% 
# 1    3    4    6   11 
```{r}
# so the IQR is 3
IQR(myNumbers) # THERE IS A FUNCTION IN R
```
# THANKS FOR WATCHING :-)
