## conduct anova for the data set (bread, our favorite one)
## how do you tell one factor in an experiment actually makes a difference
```{r}
# get the data from internet (cloud, storage or equivalent)
data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyRPy/AP_Statistics_with_R/main/Data/bread.csv"
bread <- read.csv(data_url, sep = ",", header = TRUE)
```

## build a linear model
```{r}
bread$time <- as.factor(bread$time) # do not forget this step
linearModel <- lm(height ~ time, data = bread)
```

## anova on the data
```{r}
# do a anova , anova, how it came together !
anova(linearModel)
```

## p-value 0.042 is less than 0.05, which means the time factor
## does make a significant differece in the experiment, or

## it has a very low chance ( < 0.42% ) that this factor (time) is a noise
