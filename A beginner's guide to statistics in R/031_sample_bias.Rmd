## a simple intro to 'sample bias'
```{r}
# let's generate some numbers

myNumbers <- rnorm(10000, mean = 1, sd = 1)
```
```{r}
hist(myNumbers) 
# centered at 1, most numbers are within -/+ 2
```

```{r}
# find mean
mean(myNumbers) 
# fairly close to 1, we call it no bias or unbiased
```

```{r}
# find sd
sd(myNumbers) # fairly close to 1
```

```{r}
# if we do the sample on standard errors
wrongSD <- replicate(100, (((sqrt(var(sample(myNumbers, 30, replace = TRUE))) * (30-1))/30)))
hist(wrongSD)
```

```{r}
mean(wrongSD) 
# not very far, but under estimated compared to sd = 1
```
## so there is a sample bias (difference) 
## against the true sd = 1
