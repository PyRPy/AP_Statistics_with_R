```

## prediction on linear model
```{r}
# let's get some data first
cups <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9)
age <- c(1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10) # weeks
```
```{r}
myDogFood <- data.frame(cups, age)
plot(age, cups)

```
```{r}
# linear model
linearReg <- lm(cups ~ age)
```

## we want to know how many cups a dog eat at age = 3
```{r}
# prediction based on linear model
predict(linearReg, newdata = data.frame(age = 3))
```
```{r}
# we got 10.1 roughly, check the plot
summary(linearReg)

```
```{r}
# we can calculate it manually
-0.16471 + 0.93235 * 3
```

## so we got our first prediction !
