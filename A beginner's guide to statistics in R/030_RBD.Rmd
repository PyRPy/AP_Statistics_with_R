# ------ Design and Analysis  of Experiments with R 2017 ------ #
## this example from the book above

## background information for the experiment
## use 4 types of water to irrigate the flowers - this is 'treatment'
## there are also 4 types of flowers
## here the blocks are 'flowers'
## each of the four types of flower forms a 'block'

## let's use 'agricolae' package to do the RBD experiment design
## install.packages('agricolae') # if not installed

```{r}
# load the library
library(agricolae)
```

```{r}
trt <- c(1, 2, 3, 4) # for four types of water
outdesign <- design.rcbd(trt, 4, seed = 2022)
rcb <- outdesign$book
```

```{r}
# rename the levels
levels(rcb$block) <- c("carnation", "daisy", "rose", "tulip") 
```
```{r}
# then you got the design
rcb
```
