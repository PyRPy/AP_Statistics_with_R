## Sampling for proportions 
```{r}
# create a 'population' with binomial distribution
myNumbers <- rbinom(10000, size = 30, prob = 0.333)
hist(myNumbers)
```

```{r}
# OK we got numbers for a 'population' of 10,000
# do some sampling
sample(myNumbers, 5)
```

```{r}
# repeat sampling and store them in a data matrix
# small sample
smallSamples <- replicate(1000, sample(myNumbers, 5))
hist(colMeans(smallSamples), xlim = c(6, 14))

# large sample
largeSamples <- replicate(1000, sample(myNumbers, 30))
hist(colMeans(largeSamples), xlim = c(6, 14), col = 'blue', add = TRUE)
```
# when n is large, from 5 to 30, the mean of the sample is 
# becoming narrower, close to 9 in this case, the spread of 
# the mean is much smaller than a sample size of 5
