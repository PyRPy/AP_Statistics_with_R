## simulate 'flip a coin' in R
```{r}
# head and tail, two equal possibilities, it is a fair coin
sample(c("H", "T"), 1, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# let's run it 10 time once
sample(c("H", "T"), 10, replace = TRUE)
```
```{r}
# let's flip 1000 times !
results <- sample(c("H", "T"), 1000, replace = TRUE)
sum(results == "H") / 1000
```

## it's close to 50/50, though not exactly
