## rolling a dice, how to simulate it
```{r}
# Dice example as our favorite !
# it has 6 faces
dice <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

```{r}
sample(dice, 1, replace = TRUE) 
# every time, it gives you a random choice
```

## each number has a chance of 1/6 being selected
## we will do it 100,000 times
```{r}
# we can define a variable to store the numbers
myRoll <- replicate(100000, sample(dice, 1, replace = TRUE))
```

```{r}
# how many 2s we got from these 100,000 rollings
sum(myRoll == 2)
```

```{r}
# in R, we can do it like this:
sum(myRoll == 2) / length(myRoll)

```

```{r}
# it is close to 1/6 or
1/6
```
