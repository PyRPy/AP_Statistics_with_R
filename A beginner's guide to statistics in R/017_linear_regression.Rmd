## assume a dog , how much a dog eat every day, 
## as a dog grows up (a puppy this case)
```{r}
myDogFood <- data.frame(
            cups = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9), 
            age = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10)
                        )
```

## use lm() to build a linear model
```{r}
linearReg <- lm(cups ~ age, data = myDogFood)
```

## plot regression line with original data points
```{r}

plot(myDogFood$age, myDogFood$cups)
abline(linearReg, col='blue')
```
```{r}
# let's look at the summary
summary(linearReg)
```
## intercept is -0.06667 
## coefficient : 0.921 , y = a + bx, here b = 0.921
## p-value < 0.05, significant
