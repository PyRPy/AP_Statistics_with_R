```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##  build a linear model on the experiment data
```{r}
# get the data from internet (cloud, storage or equivalent)
data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyRPy/AP_Statistics_with_R/main/Data/bread.csv"
bread <- read.csv(data_url, sep = ",", header = TRUE)
```
```{r}
bread$time <- as.factor(bread$time) # convert types for analysis
```

```{r}
# we can find the variations in the plot

linearModel <- lm(height ~ time, data = bread)
```

```{r}
# take a look at the summary
summary(linearModel)
```

## it uses time35 as baseline for comparison
## p-value: 0.042, time as a factor is signficant
## the R square is about 0.51, not ideal in this case
