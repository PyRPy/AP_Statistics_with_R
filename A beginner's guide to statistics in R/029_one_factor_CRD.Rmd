## one factor complete random design (CRD)
## examples from 'daewr' package in CRAN
## measuring effects on bread rising height 
## from time and other factors
```{r}
set.seed(2021)
f <- factor(rep(c(35, 40, 45), each = 4))
f
```

```{r}
fac <- sample(f, 12) # reshuffle, or randomize it
fac
```
```{r}
eu <- 1:12 # experiment unit number, just a ID type
test_plan <- data.frame(loaf = eu, time = fac) # we knew this before
test_plan
```
## first key concept is : to assign your experiment unit 'randomly'

## second key concept is: to 'repeat' what you want to do 

## third key concept is: blocking, if you cannot control it, you have to mark 
## it intentionally, and figure it out later when do the variance analysis,
