```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## there are 3 balls in a jar, with color of red, blue, 
## and green, the sampling with replacement, means select 
## one ball, then put it back

## if we do a binomial test, kind of, the results are:
## sample size / number of experiment 30 ; 
## we do the test for 30 times
##probability for a red ball is selected : 1/3 or 0.333

```{r}
# in R, we can do this
rbinom(1, size = 30, prob = 0.333) 
# we got 10 times for red ball

```

```{r}
# we can also do this
rbinom(10, size = 30, prob = 0.333)
```

```{r}
# the average number of how many times a red ball is sampled:
mean(rbinom(10, size = 30, prob = 0.333))
```

## size * prob = 30 x 0.333 = 10, yes it is close
