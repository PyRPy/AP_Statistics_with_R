## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## let's explore the data first, before we do linear regression
## this is called 'EDA' or exploratory data analysis

## data set 'bread' from 'daewr' package in R

```{r}
# get the data
data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyRPy/AP_Statistics_with_R/main/Data/bread.csv"
bread <- read.csv(data_url, sep = ",", header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# you can also show a few lines of data
head(bread, 3)
```
```{r}
# do a conversion on the data type
bread$time <- as.factor(bread$time)
```

```{r}
# let's do some graphs on the data
boxplot(bread[, 2:3])
```
```{r}
# not what we want
with(data = bread,
     plot(height ~ time))
```
## we can see that with different time for baking the rising height are different
