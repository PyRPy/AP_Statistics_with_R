## assume a dog , how much a dog eat every day, 
## as a dog grows up (a puppy this case)
```{r}
myDogFood <- data.frame(
            cups = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9), 
            age = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10)
                        )
```

## find correlation using cor()
```{r}
cor(myDogFood)
```

## use pairs() to find more information
```{r}
pairs(myDogFood)
```
## very strong correlation
