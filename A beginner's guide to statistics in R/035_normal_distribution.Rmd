knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## simulate a normal distribution
```{r}
# generate random numbers for a 'normal' distribution
rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 5)
```
```{r}
# store the numbers
myNumbers <- rnorm(1000, mean = 10, sd = 5)
```

```{r}
# histograms
hist(myNumbers)
```
## most often, the random numbers fall between 0 and 20
## the rule of thumb is: 95% of numbers is within 2 x sd = 5
## of the mean, which is 10, (10-2x5, 10 + 2x5 ) or (0, 20)
