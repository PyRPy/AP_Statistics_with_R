## Sampling from a normal distribution
```{r}
# is the data you collected representative ?
# let's create a random sample, size = 10000, mean = 0, std = 1
# then, collect samples

myNumbers <- rnorm(10000, 0, 1)
```

```{r}
# histograms
hist(myNumbers)
```

## fairly 'bell' shape, it is a normal distribution

```{r}
# collect some sampling here, 100 out of 1000
samples_1000 = sample(myNumbers, 1000)
hist(samples_1000)
```
## 1000 out of 10,000, fairly normal shape

```{r}
# collect some sampling here, 100 out of 10000
samples_100 = sample(myNumbers, 100)
hist(samples_100)
```

## smaller sample size, sometimes it does not look like a normal distribution
