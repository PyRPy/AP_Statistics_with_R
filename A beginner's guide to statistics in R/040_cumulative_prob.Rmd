## how to calculate cumulative probabilities
```{r}
# get some random numbers
myNumbers <- rnorm(1000, 0, 2) # sd = 2, mean = 0
hist(myNumbers)
```
## it's a normal distribution

## what's a number that has a chance, less than -4 ?
## it is 2 x sd away from the center point or 0 in this case
```{r}
pnorm(-4, 0, 2) # fairly small
```

```{r}
# how about x > 4, should be same, it is symmetrical !
 1 - pnorm(4, 0, 2)
```

```{r}
# how about between -4 and 4
pnorm(4, 0, 2) - pnorm(-4, 0, 2)
```
## 0.9544997 or 95%, 
## one of the numbers from the 'rule of thumb' !
