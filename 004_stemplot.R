# how to produce a stemplot or stem and leaf plot

# first let's produce some numbers

myNumbers <- c(11,21,24, rep(3, 5), rep(43, 5), rep(8, 10), 8, 9, 17, 12, 13, 
               rep(131, 5), rep(17, 3)) # at your wish

# produce stem plot, easy in R
stem(myNumbers)

# odd enough ?

# let's change the numbers we produced
# that's something new !
